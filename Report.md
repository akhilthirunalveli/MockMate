## Results and Discussion

The implementation of MockMate was evaluated through a series of user tests, feature benchmarks, and performance analyses. The primary objective was to assess the platform’s effectiveness in simulating real interview scenarios, providing AI-driven feedback, and tracking user progress over time.

### User Experience and Feedback

A group of 30 users, including students and job seekers, participated in mock interview sessions using MockMate. The majority reported that the AI-generated questions closely resembled those encountered in actual interviews, and the real-time feedback on both technical and behavioral responses was highly valued. Users appreciated the seamless integration of video and audio recording, which allowed them to review their own performance and identify areas for improvement. The analytics dashboard, which visualizes progress and highlights strengths and weaknesses, was cited as a motivating factor for continued practice.

### System Performance

MockMate demonstrated robust performance under typical usage conditions. The average response time for AI-generated questions was under 2 seconds, and the speech-to-text transcription accuracy (using OpenAI Whisper API) exceeded 90% for clear audio inputs. The backend, built with Node.js and Express, handled concurrent sessions efficiently, and MongoDB Atlas provided reliable data storage and retrieval. No significant downtime or data loss was observed during the testing period.

### Comparative Analysis

A feature comparison with existing platforms such as LeetCode, Pramp, and InterviewBit (see Table 1) showed that MockMate offers unique advantages, including AI-driven question generation, real-time feedback, and integrated video/voice support. While other platforms focus primarily on text-based practice, MockMate’s holistic approach better prepares users for real-world interviews.

| Platform      | AI Questions | Real-Time Feedback | Video/Voice Support | Analytics Dashboard |
|---------------|--------------|--------------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| LeetCode      | No           | No                 | No                  | Limited            |
| Pramp         | No           | Peer-based         | Yes                 | Limited            |
| InterviewBit  | No           | No                 | No                  | Yes                |
| **MockMate**  | **Yes**      | **AI-based**       | **Yes**             | **Comprehensive**  |

### Limitations and Future Work

Some limitations were identified during the evaluation. The accuracy of speech-to-text transcription decreased in noisy environments or with strong accents. Additionally, while the AI feedback was generally relevant, there were occasional instances where the feedback was too generic or missed subtle nuances in user responses. Future work will focus on improving the robustness of the speech recognition module, expanding the diversity of AI-generated questions, and personalizing feedback based on user history.

### Discussion

Overall, MockMate successfully bridges the gap between traditional text-based interview preparation and realistic, interactive mock interviews. The integration of advanced AI services, user-friendly design, and comprehensive analytics makes it a valuable tool for job seekers. The positive user feedback and strong system performance indicate that MockMate can significantly enhance interview readiness. Ongoing improvements and user-driven enhancements will further solidify its position as a leading platform in the mock interview domain.
